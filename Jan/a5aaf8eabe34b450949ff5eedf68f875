"According to the complainant, he noticed that his partner's card was being used while he lay in hospital. “The card was still used even after he passed away," Mbele said. She said the first withdrawal was made at the hospital in Berea. “Video footage was not clear enough and the investigating officer from Umbilo SAPS continued to look into the matter. “The police officer visited one of the stores where a purchase was made and then went to another shop in Glenwood where video footage assisted in confirming that the card was used by the first accused who was dressed in uniform,” Mbele said. The nurse was arrested and some of the items that he bought were recovered. The suspect told the police the card was with his friend, who is the second accused in this case. Mbele said the second suspect was also nabbed. She said this was not the nurse's first brush with the law.
