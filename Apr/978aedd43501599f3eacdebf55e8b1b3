It’s that time again friends! That time when we start buying marshmallow eggs and hot cross buns, while we call up the family to plan the longest weekend of the year!! But, what if we shake things up in 2021 and level all the way up? Let’s paint the picture… Imagine this… instead of doing the usual lunch at uGogo’s table with the same pics, the same food, and the same jazz CD your uncle loves to jam to, you could make a whole new family moment somewhere exciting, and turn it into a real forever-memory that none of us will ever forget! After all, Easter shouldn’t be about faffing around and vryfing stoeps, but rather about love, laughs and lekker times.
