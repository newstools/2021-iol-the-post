Durban – Nazir Sadack believes service delivery in the eThekwini will only improve if the municipality improves its management. “There’s not a day that goes by where we don't have a service delivery issue. Tongaat is a small town but with the development of duplexes and apartments the population has grown, but our infrastructure has remained the same,” said Sadack, a community activist and community police forum member. “The area was developed for a limited number of residents. When more houses were built, the municipality did not increase the sewer line and as a result, the manholes overflow and the water remains stagnant. “Then there is the issue of the roads. There are numerous potholes and the barriers along the main road in Tongaat need to be repaired. To add to this, most of the street lights don’t work, the bushes are overgrown and Durban Solid Waste does not pick up the residents’ refuse on the designated days. “The CBD is also dirty. Previously, street sweepers arrived in the mornings to clean up but that hasn’t happened in years. We always seem to be lodging complaints but it takes the departments, and the workers, a while to respond. “Sometimes it feels like we have to beg them to do their jobs. The councillors try to help but there’s only so much they can do. It all starts with the city's management. They need to ensure that they employ the right people to do the jobs correctly and within a reasonable time so that communities don’t suffer.” The Post
