DURBAN - Richard Mbulu’s 37th-minute goal consigned AmaZulu to their first competitive defeat since February as Usuthu fell to a 1-0 loss against Baroka FC at the King Zwelethini Stadium. The result also marked AmaZulu’s first league defeat since they lost to Kaizer Chiefs in January. Bakgaga’s goal came against the run of play with Evidence Makgopa first producing a dummy before finding Mbulu who cut in from the inside and fired in a shot which sailed beyond AmaZulu keeper Veli Mothwa.

After meeting a pass from Siyethemba Sithebe in the 43rd minute, Lehlohonolo Majoro struck for goal and forced a brilliant save from Baroka keeper Oscarine Masuluke.

Usuthu failed to emulate the type of play they have shown since McCarthy was appointed as their coach as they uncharacteristically misplaced passes with mid-table Baroka looking like the better side for most of the game.
