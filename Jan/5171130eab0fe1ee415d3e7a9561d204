Durban - For more than three decades Detective Warrant Officer Ashok Baldowu of Mountain Rise SAPS in Pietermaritzburg served his community and hoped to be promoted to the rank of captain this year. However, before realising his goal, the 49-year-old from Raisethorpe died on Christmas Day from Covid-19. His wife, Vanashree Pillay, said he experienced flu-like symptoms, including a sore throat, a heavy chest, nasal congestion and fever four days prior to his death. “At first, the symptoms were mild. We went to the doctor on December 23 and he advised that Ashok be tested for the virus. On Christmas morning, he was unwell and I called the paramedics but he died before they arrived. At this stage, we had not yet received his Covid-19 results. The paramedics called the laboratory and they confirmed he was positive.” She said her husband completed 30 years at SAPS last June. “He loved his job and wore his badge with pride. My husband also assisted and shared his knowledge with his younger colleagues. Ashok wanted to improve himself and he was confident that he would be promoted this year. His career meant the world to him.” Pillay said Baldowu was a loving husband and father. “He would go out of his way to make everyone happy.” Baldowu was cremated at the Cedar Ridge Crematorium on December 27. He is survived by his wife and two children, Ashlen and Ashleesha. The Post
