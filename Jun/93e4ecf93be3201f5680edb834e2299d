Cape Town - If there is one thing South Africans know how to do online, it is to drool over attractive people. This was the case after the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development (DOJ and CD) innocently posted a picture of one of its employees as part of a Youth Month initiative. This yea,r National Youth Day and Youth Month are being celebrated under the theme ‚ÄúThe Year of Charlotte Mannya Maxeke: Growing youth employment for an inclusive and transformed society‚Äù. As part of its Youth Month initiative, the DOJ&CD Western Cape Regional Office visited St Mary and Northwood Primary Schools to educate learners on the Constitution and various services in the department.

I'm prepped and ready - let's go!  And if you had managed to read to the bottom of the story to find out if Kwababana is single, he is not. He revealed in December 2020 that he got married, and cannot wait to spend the rest of his life with his stunning wife. I enjoyed both days of my wedding, I cannot wait to spend the rest of my life with my wife and soon we will be expanding our family (prophecy) hence my name "Lwandiso". pic.twitter.com/LMZwWCHrCU
