CAPE TOWN - A gang’s rampage at an elite Cape Town car dealership has gone viral on social media. CCTV captured how the gang of about 40 people entered the store and damaged at least eight vehicles and assaulted staff. On Wednesday morning The Toy Shop in Woodbridge Island, Milnerton, which specialises in exotic and special vehicles, was ambushed. According to reports, the suspects came into the store demanding two vehicles and when they were denied, they started their attack, damaging eight cars. CCTV footage of the incident shows a large group of men entering the dealership. Seconds later they are seen smashing the windows of the vehicles and physically attacking the staff. The incident takes less than a minute, and before it’s all over, a suspect in an orange hoodie returns and corners two of the dealership’s staff demanding their valuables, while another suspect is behind him holding a firearm. SAPS spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said that cases of business robbery and malicious damage to property were opened for investigation. “The circumstances surrounding an incident that occurred this morning at a car dealer in Brooklyn are under investigation. According to information, about 40 suspects entered the business premises threatened the employees with firearms and demanded two vehicles. They were not given vehicles, thereafter, the suspects smashed windows and lights of vehicles on display,” Rwexana said. “Eight vehicles were damaged.
