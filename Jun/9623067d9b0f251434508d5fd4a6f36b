DURBAN - POLICE minister General Bheki Cele is expected to give an update on investigations into political killings in KwaZulu-Natal. As part of his update, Cele will provide information on work undertaken by the Inter-Ministerial Committee and their interventions thus far. The IMC was appointed by President Cyril Ramaphosa to address political killings in the province. In June last year, Cele expressed concerns over a resurgence of violence in the province. At the time, he said the team was looking into at least eight instances of politically-related deaths. In June last year,  uMlazi ward councillor Bhekithemba Phungula was gunned down outside his home. Cele slammed the attack. â€œBeing known for political killings was not something nice for KwaZulu-Natal. By looking at the figures starting in May and June, about eight people have been murdered in this province. These are suspected political killings," he said. IOL
