Cape Town - Gauteng Premier David Makhura has announced that the third wave of Covid-19 has hit the province. For the past two days the province has been recording over 1 000 positive cases.

Making the announcement earlier today, Makhura said the province was in the grip of a Covid-19 third wave. “Having seen over 1000 cases a day we cannot afford to close down the provinces economy but definitely we want to see an increase in restrictions,” said Makhura.

On Thursday, the government reported that Covid-19 cases had increased by 3, 221 in the last 24 hours, heightening fears of the dreaded third wave.
