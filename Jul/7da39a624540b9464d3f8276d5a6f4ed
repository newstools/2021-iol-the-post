Durban: The total estimated value for the PowerBall and PowerBall Plus jackpots for tonight’s draw is R123 million. National lottery operator Ithuba says it is the Powerball’s 17th roll-over. The estimated PowerBall jackpot is R105m and the PowerBall Plus R18m. Ithuba chief executive Charmaine Mabuza urged South Africans to use digital platforms as the country observes level 4 lockdown. The latest Powerball win was on May 4, when two winners each walked away with R56m of the R112m jackpot. One of them, a Western Cape father, said one of his priorities was to exhume the bodies of his loved ones and rebury them in a more secure and peaceful place. The other winner was a Richard’s Bay stay-at-home-mom who had spent R7 to buy her winning ticket. “I will use the winnings to buy my son and his wife a brand-new house and car. I will also help by looking after my mother financially and assist my best friend who is going through financial difficulties at the moment. I will invest the rest of my winnings,” she said. IOL
