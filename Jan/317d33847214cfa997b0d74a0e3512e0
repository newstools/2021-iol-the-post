Durban - One person has been arrested and police are pursuing a group of other people who went on the rampage in the Durban city on Monday, looting and setting shops alight. According to police, the drama began after a group of about 30 people at King DiniZulu Park indicating that they wanted to march to the city hall to hand over a memorandum. “Police informed them that they would not be allowed to march. Whilst this was happening, another group converged in the city and began looting shops,” police spokesman, Colonel Jay Naicker said. He said reports were received of two shops as well as a stall belonging to a street vendor that were set alight. “Police officers from Durban Central and Metro police responded. They pursed the group and one suspect was arrested.  He attempted to stab police officers during the arrest but was quickly subdued without any injury to any of the arresting officers.  Some stolen items were recovered from the arrested suspects,” he said. It was not known what was behind Monday’s mob action or if it was linked to growing anti-foreigner sentiment by some groups that have carried out similar tactics in the past. Firefighter were called in to extinguish the blaze to the shops that were set alight by, according to the Durban Metro Police, a form of accelerant. Naicker said n operation was still ongoing to identify and arrest the other perpetrators. “A case of public violence has been opened for further investigation. The arrested suspect will also be charged with attempted murder,” he said. IOL
