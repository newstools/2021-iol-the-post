Durban - Chanel Genevieve Marlin, 27, of Shallcross was on her way to visit her grandparents in Gillitis when she was killed in a motor vehicle collision on Thursday afternoon. The driver of another vehicle, a man in his 30s, sustained serious injuries. A third vehicle was also involved and the occupant sustained slight injuries. Marlin’s father, Marlin Naicker, described his daughter as “a bubbly, joyous soul who touched the hearts of whoever she came into contact with”. He said Marlin had lost her mom when she was 17, but had grown up to be a “strong, determined and driven young woman”. Naicker said she had become a leader and inspiration to her younger sister and cousins. He said his daughter had a degree in diagnostic radiography and was specialising in mammography. Marlin was working at R K Khan Hospital. Keagan Govender, from the Christian Revival Centre dance team and Judah Dance Academy team, said Marlin had helped train the children. “I can truly say she was dynamite in a small package. She had a passion for dancing and an even greater passion for Jesus. She loved worship dances and shined brightly in vernacular dance pieces. “She would also train many younger dancers in the Judah Dance Academy from ages 4 to 16. So many of them grew fond of her zeal for life and her ability to relate to the kids. It's going to be hard to imagine moments ahead without her but we know the impact she had will remain.” Govender said she also counselled the younger kids if they were troubled. “There could never be a dull moment with her around and she always had the most beautiful words of encouragement to share. Our team will definitely miss this beautiful soul but we know she is now dancing in the clouds of glory for our saviour.” POST
