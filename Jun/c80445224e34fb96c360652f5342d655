 DURBAN – Armed robbers shot and killed a security guard in Tongaat yesterday. The 40-year-old guard and his colleague were on duty guarding a reservoir in Emona Tongaat when they came under attack. The guards were also robbed of their firearms. Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said it is alleged that at 8.45pm last night, two security guards were on duty at Emona in Tongaat when they were attacked by three unknown armed males. “One of the suspects fired a shot at the 40-year-old security guard. He sustained gunshots wounds on the upper body and was declared dead at the scene. “The suspects robbed the victims of their firearms before fleeing the scene,” she said. Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) said a resident in the area contacted the security company’s Tongaat operations center at 8.52pm. Rusa spokesperson Prem Balram said a resident reported shots being fired near his/her property. He said a Rusa patrol was flagged by one of the security guards who had been attacked for assistance for his unresponsive colleague. Balram said Rusa medics were dispatched and upon arrival found the wounded guard on his back in a shipping container. He sustained a gunshot wound to his back and was declared deceased. “According to his colleague, they were tasked with guarding the reservoir when three suspects entered the premises and held them up. Their attackers deprived both security officers of their .38 Special revolvers and their cellphones. “During the robbery the suspects fired at least three shots before they fled on foot in an unknown direction. A 9mm bullet and three spent cartridges were recovered,” said Balram. Charges of murder and robbery are being investigated by Tongaat SAPS.    THE MERCURY
