AFTER almost two years of back-and-forth court appearances and the possibility of the matter being struck off the roll, the State is finally ready to proceed with the case against former eThekwini mayor, Zandile Gumede and several high profile officials within the municipality. Today, the National Prosecuting Authority said the matter has been transferred to the Durban High Court for a pre-trial conference on June 14. Gumede was arrested on raft of charges, including fraud, corruption and racketeering, relating to an apparent dodgy R400 million Durban Solid Waste tender. Her co-accused in the matter includes city manager Sipho Nzuza and other top officials and councillors and are accused of inflating the contract from R25m to more than R400m. They also face allegations of allegedly splitting the contract between four companies that did not have any waste removal experience or infrastructure by manipulating the award process.
