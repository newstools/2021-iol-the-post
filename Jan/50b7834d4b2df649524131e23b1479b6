Durban - Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife has shut down its Hiltop Resort situated inside Hluhluwe iMfolozi Park with immediate effect after the resort manager tested positive for Covid-19. Guests currently at the resort have been informed and they will be allowed to self-isolate within the resort provided they are willing to cook and do house-keeping for themselves, Ezemvelo said in a statement on Saturday. Musa Mntambo, head of corporate at Ezemvelo said the closure of the resort is a precautionary measure and was also in line with the advice received from  Ezemvelo’s medical team. “The advice follows the Covid-19 positive test results of one of the Resort Managers who, as part of his duties, interacted with all resort staff as well as the guests. The Resort will probably open on Thursday, 07 January 2021,” he said. All guests who have bookings during the affected dates will be requested to transfer their bookings to  Mpila Resort which is within Hluhluwe iMfolozi Park or Mantuma Resort at Mkhuze Game Reserve, Ezemvelo said. They will also be allowed to choose any other Ezemvelo Resort should they prefer  not to transfer to either of the two resorts indicated above. According to Ezemvelo they will also be amenable to requests of re-booking to a different future date or refunds. All three main gates Memorial, Nyalazi, and Cengeni gates will remain open and the public is encouraged to visit the park and make use of the Centenary Centre to buy food as the Hiltop restaurant is also closed.
