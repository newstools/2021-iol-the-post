DURBAN - The Department of Water and Sanitation’s weekly status of reservoirs indicates that KwaZulu-Natal water storage capacity has moved up to 71.7% this week, a slight improvement compared to last week’s 71.1% and last year’s 60.5% respectively. A total of four out of five dams that are part of Umgeni Water Supply System seem to have benefited from the scattered rainfall experienced in the last few days, this also influenced the outlook of the province as a whole. Both Woodstock and Zaaihoek dams within the Integrated Vaal River System (IVRS) are unchanged with the first at 101.6% and the latter at 80.7%. Umgeni Water Supply System slightly increased from 80.8% last week to 81.2% this week.
