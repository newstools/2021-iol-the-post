Of these, 39 612 tests were conducted since the last report. The total vaccinated under the Sisonke Programme is 480 665. These vaccinations were with the one-dose Johnson and Johnson vaccine and are therefore completed vaccinations. The total vaccinated in phase 2 as at 5.10pm yesterday was 116 741. These vaccinations were with the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine.   Meanwhile, seriously ill Covid-19 patients in African countries are more likely to pass away than those on other continents, which could be because of a lack of critical care equipment, a study published on Friday said. Africa's populations have so far been less badly hit by the pandemic than other regions when it comes to total number of cases and deaths -- but the authors suggest the mortality rate of those who do get sick could be even higher than their figures suggest because of a lack of data. "Our study is the first to give a detailed and comprehensive picture of what is happening to people who are severely ill with Covid-19 in Africa," Bruce Biccard from Groote Schuur Hospital and the University of Cape Town said. "Sadly, it indicates that our ability to provide sufficient care is compromised by a shortage of critical care beds and limited resources within intensive care units.’’ On average, 31.5% of critically ill patients passed away after admission to intensive care in Asia, Europe and the Americas, compared to 48.2% in African countries.
