OPINION - IT IS with profound sadness that the sporting  fraternity has learnt of the passing of Abdul Bhamjee. He will most fondly be remembered for his warm personality, generosity, dynamism and charisma. Having excelled as a player in both cricket and football, he later utilised and focused his considerable talents and skills into the administration side of sport. His accomplishments as a sporting promoter in particular catapulted him into the national spotlight and made him a household name. Abdul’s oratory skills and chutzpah were legendary. His larger-than-life aura and personality were enough to fill a stadium, never mind a room. He was a man of indomitable spirit, courage, tenacity and resolve. I had the honour and privilege to have worked alongside him for over two decades and was impressed by both his ideals and his strong work ethic, which ensured that he accomplished all goals of non-racialism and normalisation of sport across the racial divide. He embodied the fight against injustice and ensured the mantra of “no normal sport in an abnormal society” reached its desired effect and conclusion. Abdul Bhamjee’s  contribution to sport in South Africa cannot and will not be forgotten. He  leaves behind a legacy that will benefit sportsmen for generations to come. His sacrifice and determination to fight for equality and social justice across all spheres of life will be remembered in the annals of South Africa’s history. We were indeed fortunate to have him in the trenches in the war against the apartheid machine. He fought the good fight and his selflessness and courage ensured the war was won. Abdul was the right man at the right time, a man for all seasons and a giant among men. Long may he be remembered. Mahomed Sibda and Farouk Araie BENONI Daily News
