Durban - The search for a 16-year-old boy who is believed to have drowned at Blythedale Beach, KwaDukuza, on the KZN North Coast enters its fifth day today. The teenager was swimming last Thurday when he got into difficulty and was swept away by the current. KZN provincial police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed the incident and said it took place just after 4.30pm. IPSS Medical Rescue’s Search and Rescue division said they responded to the scene together with lifeguards, the SAPS K9 unit and police divers. Paul Herbst, IPSS division spokesperson, said when people noticed the boy was drowning, they tried calling for help. “He got into difficulties and just went under. He was not seen after that,” he said. He said over the past few days, the teams’ effort had not yielded any success. Herbst said that during the search, crews conducted shore patrols as well as patrols out at sea. He said that aerial support was provided using a drone, a helicopter and microlight planes to try to locate the body. The search was called off yesterday and would continue today. KwaDukuza Local Municipality spokesperson Sipho Mkhize said the teams had extended the search area from Blythedale Beach to around Prince’s Grant Beach and the Umvoti River Mouth. Mkhize warned parents and guardians to watch children when they were swimming. “In many instances, we find that children are swimming alone without anyone monitoring them. That should stop. “We urge people to take responsibility for their children. Also, people must not consume alcohol and swim, it is extremely dangerous,” he warned. According to Mkhize, the beach was not closed. The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) had previously issued a warning to beachgoers to be extra cautious when swimming at beaches. The Mercury
