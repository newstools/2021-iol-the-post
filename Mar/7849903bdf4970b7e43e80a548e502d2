Therefore, it is crucial for all of us to continue adhering to the precautions, such as the wearing of face masks when venturing into the public or when in the company of elderly people or those with comorbidities, social distancing of at least 2 metres and regular washing of hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitiser.” IOL
