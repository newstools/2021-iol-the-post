PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to address the country today at 8pm on government’s response to persistent public violence in parts of the country. “The address will follow the announcement by the SA National Defence Force (SANDF) that it has commenced with pre-deployment processes and procedures in line with a request for assistance received from the National Joint Operational and Intelligence Structure,” said Acting Minister in the Presidency, Khumbudzo Ntshavheni. PRESIDENT TO ADDRESS NATION ON OUTBREAKS OF VIOLENCE President @CyrilRamaphosa will address the nation at 20h00 today, Monday, 12 July 2021, on government’s response to persistent public violence in parts of the country. The request entails SANDF support for police operations in parts of KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng. In terms of Section 201(2)(a) of the Constitution, the president may authorise the deployment of the national defence force in co-operation with the police service and must inform Parliament of such employment. The president is on record as calling for calm and warning criminal elements that they will face the full might of law as lawlessness is brought to an end and economic activity is allowed to continue. The majority of South Africans do not and should not tolerate violence, the  destruction of property and the endangering of livelihoods. People are urged to report criminals by sharing videos of criminal activity with the police. “People are also asked to pay attention to what they post on social media and to be aware that the sharing of fake news or content that incites violence and looting is a crime,” Ntshavheni said. She added that it is also a crime to possess, receive and use stolen goods or to interfere with the police in their execution of their duties. IOL
