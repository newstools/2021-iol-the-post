Durban - A cacophony of police sirens tore through the early morning buzz of the Durban Magistrate’s Court on Thursday as a convoy comprising heavily armed police transported two alleged Wentworth gangsters to court to face charges of murdering a teenager. The men, Tyrese Pretorius aka "Minnie" and Codey Hoffenberg aka "Banks" were escorted by members of the KZN Anti-Gang Unit members, detectives, Brighton Beach SAPS and the Durban Metro Police for the murder of  15-year-old Joran Jacobs. Joran was shot and killed in a drive-by shooting near his home in Wentworth on June 13. Pretorius, 21, and Hoffenberg, 35, are said to be high ranking members of the notorious Cartel gang that is in the midst of a bloody war with the Hollywood gang over the lucrative drug trade. The pair made a brief appearance in the Durban Magistrate’s Court where they did not enter plea. Their cases was remanded until July 1 for a formal bail application. Pretorius who is accused number 2 and Hoffenberg who is accused number 3 in the matter will join 21-year-old Allazay Bernon, accused number 1 in the matter at their next court appearance. Bernon was arrested last week by detectives based at the Wentworth police station. He abandoned his bail application on Wednesday.  The murder case has since been taken over by the Anti-Gang Unit of the Provinical Organised Crime Investigation who were able to link Pretorius and Hoffenberg to the shooting. Pretorius was arrested at court on Wednesday whilst attending Bernon’s matter. Hoffenberg handed himself over to detectives after word got out that the police were looking for him. Wentworth has been at the epicentre of a series of gang-related shootings in recent weeks as several gangs wrestle for control over the drug trade. IOL
