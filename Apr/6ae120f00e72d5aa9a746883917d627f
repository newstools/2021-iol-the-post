Durban – The PowerBall estimated jackpot for Friday, April 9,  is R65million. According to national lottery Ithuba, if someone walks away with the prize they would become the winner of the biggest jackpot for the year. The PowerBall Plus estimated jackpot is R22m. IThuba chief executive Charmaine Mabuza said: “Our players are important to us and offering them bigger jackpots to play for, has always been Ithuba’s objective and priority. “The current PowerBall jackpots are sure to make a huge difference in the life of one or more lucky players.” This year the National Lottery has created over 26 million winners across all games since the beginning of 2021, and R800m has been paid out in total winnings.
