Durban - The whereabouts of actor Pranesh Maharaj remains unknown. Maharaj, 48, of Somerset Park, uMhlanga, left his home on February 7. He was travelling in a Hyundai i10. Dawn Gounden, a forensic consultant working with missing persons and the family spokesperson, said Maharaj left home at 6.15am to buy cigarettes from a nearby garage but did not return. She said his sister reported him missing at the Durban North SAPS. During the search, Gounden and her team checked the CCTV footage at the garage but there is no record of him being there that day. A few days after his disappearance, police in the Eastern Cape found his vehicle in the Bisho area. The tyres were stripped. Gounden said family and friends remained concerned about his safety. “They are praying for his return. It has been a difficult couple of weeks.” At the time of his disappearance, he was wearing black chino pants, a blue T-shirt and blue long-sleeve shirt. Captain Nqobile Gwala, a provincial police spokesperson, confirmed that Maharaj was still missing. Anyone with details of his whereabouts is asked to call Gounden on 074 712 5855. The Post
