Durban - A POLICEMAN and his attacker were both shot dead yesterday when police responded to a domestic violence incident in Chatsworth. Constable Royal Ndlovu, 43, from Chatsworth SAPS, was responding to a domestic violence case in Welbedacht East at 9.30am. Police spokesperson Colonel Brenda Muridili said two constables were accompanying a woman home after she reported a domestic violence complaint at Chatsworth police station. Muridili said when the constables arrived at the complainant’s yard a shot was fired from inside the house before the police could enter. “Constable Ndlovu was shot in the upper body above his bullet proof vest. When the officer fell to the ground a suspect ran out of the house firing randomly. The other constable fired back, fatally wounding the suspect,” Muridilli said. Nldovu died at the scene. Muridili said Ndlovu was an experienced member of the police with 11 years’ service. The firearm used by the suspect was confiscated. Ndlovu had taken a religious studies course because he intended to join the spiritual service in the SAPS. Chatsworth Community Policing Fourm chairperson Jakes Singh said he was disheartened that gender-based violence had claimed the life of a dedicated policeman. “As much as we educate and conduct workshops to end gender-based violence there needs to be more intervention. This shows the type of perpetrators we have that abuse their loved ones and also take out their rage against law enforcement. It’s a bitter pill to swallow. The members at the station are disheartened. We inform the community to reach out for help,” said Singh. Daily News
