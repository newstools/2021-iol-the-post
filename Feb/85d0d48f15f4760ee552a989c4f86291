Durban - Siddanth Varanasi, a Crawford International College La Lucia top-achiever, is a step closer to his dream of becoming the next Bill Gates or Steve Jobs. He attained 8 distinctions in engineering graphics and design, English, geography, Hindi, information technology, life orientation, maths and physical science. Varanasi and his family moved from India to Durban three years ago and now live in Mount Edgecombe. Although Durban is a city he has grown to love, he plans to leave for the US to study computer science. He said he was accepted at eight of the 12 universities he applied to. This includes the University of Michigan and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Varanasi said he was captivated with computers and technology and wanted to be part of developing new technology that was able to create bigger and better things than what was available now. “Ever since I was a kid, I was fascinated with computers and the smart world, which is constantly evolving. It would be a dream come true to be the next Bill Gates or Steve Jobs.” To cope with his studies, he said he created a schedule. "I sat at my desk from morning until the afternoon and attended the online classes. I took notes and asked questions if I did not understand something. I made sure I had my meals in between.” He said he also watched YouTube videos to help him understand certain concepts. Varanasi said he struggled with not being able to see his friends and but was able to interact with them on his Playstation. He said if there was one thing the pandemic had taught him, it was that family are everything. "We need to cherish every moment we have.” He encouraged the matric class of 2021 to always ask questions and to ensure they understood what they were learning. “If I was curious, I Googled it to gain a better understanding. I find learning and understanding the subject is better than just memorising notes. Also, live in the moment and do your best.” The Post
