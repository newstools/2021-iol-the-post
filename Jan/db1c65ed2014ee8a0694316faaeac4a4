Durban - DR Mahomed Moosa Jadwat believed it was his duty to help as many patients as he could. He worked as a general practitioner in Isipingo Rail for 50 years and retired in 2015. "My dad grew up in Isipingo Rail and Isipingo Beach. He was a well-known doctor, who was not driven by financial gain or reward but to ensure that everyone who needed treatment received it whether they could pay or not," said his son, Zeyn Jadwat. Jadwat, of Riverside, died at the Ahmed Al-Kadi Hospital on January 1. He was 87. "Patients appreciated him. It was evident from all the calls and messages that were shared on social media about the type of doctor and person he was. He really made a difference in many lives." Zeyn said his dad had flu-like symptoms and tested for the virus on December 23. The results confirmed the following day that he was Covid-positive. “Two days later, he was admitted to the hospital. He did not have a long battle. On the day of his passing, we had a personal caregiver at his side. He told her that he was tired and was going to sleep and had turned to his side. Shortly after, he had passed away peacefully.” He said his father, a former mayor in Isipingo, lived a quiet and family-oriented life. “If he was not spending time with his siblings then you would find him watching sports on television like cricket and football. He also played soccer at a local club in Isipingo in his younger years. My dad lived a fulfilling life." Jadwat was buried at the Al-Hilal Cemetery in Overport on New Year's Day. He leaves his three sons, Zeyn, Naim and Ahmed, and 11 grandchildren.
